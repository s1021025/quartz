#### Why Insufficient Labeled Data is essential to Computer Vision ?

Image classification is a significant problem that can be addressed by computer vision techniques. The commonly employed approach is supervised learning, where a labeled dataset is required. In this approach, an algorithm is developed to extract features from images and learn patterns. Once the model has learned from the labeled data, it can make predictions on unseen images based on its acquired knowledge. The need for a substantial amount of labeled data arises from the fact that it helps in training the model to effectively solve real-world problems.

However, labelled data is hard to retrieve in specific industry. For example:
